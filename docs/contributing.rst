Contributing
============

Workflow is pretty straightforward:

* Clone the GitHub repo
* Make a change
* Make sure all tests passed
* Make sure all changes are covered by tests
* Add a record to CHANGELOG.md
* Commit changes to own core-service clone
* Make pull request from github page for your clone against develop branch
